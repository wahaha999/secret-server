# Secret Server Coding Task

## Introduction

Your task is to implement a secret server and a React UI to manage the secrets. The secret server can be used to store and share secrets. But the secret can be read only before the expiration time. The secret may have TTL. After the expiration time the secret
wonâ€™t be available anymore. You can find the detailed API documentation in the swagger.yaml file.
We recommend to use [Swagger](https://editor.swagger.io/) or any other OpenAPI implementation to
read the documentation.

## Task

**Implementation**: You have to implement the whole Secret Server API in NodeJS and MongoDB with any framework of your choice. However it would be wise to store the data using encryption, now this is not part of the task. You can use plain text to store your secrets.
Also create a React.js UI for it, where the user can add and retrieve the secrets by hash.

**Response types**
The API must be able to response with JSON, based on the [Accept header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept). Other response types (such as YAML) might be added later so prepare your code to be extandable.

**Hosting**: You also have to deploy and host the service. There are plenty of free solutions to do this. So this shouldn't
be an issue. If this API was used in production, then HTTPS would be a must but this is not the case now. It is allowed to use HTTP too.

**Share the code**: Upload the code to your GitHub account and share with us.
